Software Engineer working as a full stack developer in Brazil.

In 2018 I decided to do an exchange program in Australia, this experience was incredible. Their cultura, lifestyles are quite different. I had good and bad experiences, but both of them help me to be more tolerant, more independent and much more flexible, you learn to value small achievements.

I have many things to talk about and I love to help others that are planning to live in Australia. So one day I have some posts in English and others in Portuguese. You can see the posts on my website.
